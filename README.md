# geoai-big-data-africa-school
A project proposed in the context of the [5th Big Data Africa School](https://www.sarao.ac.za/students/5th-big-data-africa-school/) by Sabrina Amrouche on behalf of the GeoAI-Africa community.

In this Project, we will: 

* Exploit real ground station weather data
* Build an ML model to generate short-term forecasts
* Discuss several use-cases of weather forecasts

Start here:
* Read about [ERA5](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview)
* Read about [TAHMO](https://tahmo.org/)
* Read about why weather forecasting matters from [WMO/WBO](https://alliancehydromet.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/The-Value-of-Surface-based-Meteorological-Observation-Data.pdf)
* Read about [WeatherBench](https://sites.research.google/weatherbench/) the most popular framework for DL weather forecast benchmarking
